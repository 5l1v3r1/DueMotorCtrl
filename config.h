//The two values PWM_FREQ and MAX_PWM_DUTY should form an even divisor to the 84Mhz main clock
//The clock used can be from 1x divisor to 255 but will be integer increments
//The equation is 84Mhz / (Freq * Duty * 2)
//So, with 7KHz PWM we get 84Mhz / 7Khz = 12k. It divides evenly.
//The max duty being 1000 means 12k turns into 12. Then, center aligned mode brings it down to 6.
//The register can take a value of 6 so this works out.
//10500 instead gives a register value of 4 so that works too.

//These below values form a window. If the ADC values of current sensor 1 goes outside this window the PWM fault line will trigger and PWM will shut down
//this forms a reasonably fast fault mechanism but it is not as reliable or fast as a hardware solution. But, if you're using a DMOC then the
//DMOC power hardware has hardware based faulting anyway. This is just a backup mechanism.
//The current sensors on a dmoc have a scaling factor of about 0.5 so each value here is 1/2 an amp. Plan accordingly.
